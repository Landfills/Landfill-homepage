				<div class="article-summary">
					<span class="article-paragraph-summary">Landfill for New York project aims to bring local residents together with a diverse group of experts and artists to understand and imagine the potential of the Edgemere site. New York City’s legacy landfills were sited to obscure their environmental and community impacts. By capping landfills like Edgemere, the City may have turned a negative influence into, at best, a net neutral. With the residents as direct partners we intend to explore strategies to create a positive impact out of an environmental scar such as Edgemere.<br></span>

					<span class="article-paragraph-normal">Edgemere Landfill, a former municipal dump in the Rockaways, Queens, has been closed for over 20 years. The landfill operated as a disposal site from 1938 to 1991, receiving about 1200 tons of waste per day. Today, Edgemere landfill is capped and is at the end of remedia­tion process that converted the dump into a spectacular, and yet unused, 173-acre site of­fering views of Jamaica Bay and the Manhattan skyline. The land is facing an as-yet-undeter­mined future. Its location in one of the most vulnerable – both environmentally and socially – areas of New York City suggests the great potential impact of the choice that will define its future.<br>
					Landfill for New York is a collaboration among  Elliott Maltby, Simon Kates and Sonya Gimon, Martha Willson and Rockaway Waterfront Alliance;<br> The project is part of Taconic Fellowship offered by Pratt Center for Community Development.<br>
					<a href class="text-link"="https://www.rwalliance.org">Rockaway Waterfront Alliance</a> is a community-based organization dedicated to empowering residents of underserved communities in the Rockaways to play a role in the determination of their neighborhoods. RWA provides enriching education and community programming, which instill both individual and civic respect for nature, and contribute to advancing the physical, economic and social sustainability in the Rockaway Peninsula. <br>In 2016, RWA completed renovation of the former FDNY Company 265 Firehouse located at Beach 59th St & Rockaway Beach Blvd into <a href class="text-link"="https://www.rwalliance.org/rwa/projects/projects_3/">RISE: Rockaway Institute for Sustainable Environment</a>; a center for community- based programs and collaboration focused on environmental concerns in the region including the environmental, economic, physical health and well being of the local Rockaway community.

				<p class="article-title">Team</p>
				<div class="article-summary">
					<span class="article-paragraph-summary">While all of the members of team represent different professions, they all share an interest and experience in bringing arts, science and urban design together as a way to create a change. Many of their projects are site-based, often sites that have an ambiguous reputation or are at the periphery of the urban design conversation. Their interests vary from cemeteries as new urban green spaces, city fortification water systems as catalyst for contemporary culture to abandoned ocean shores. These site are linked: natural or human-made landforms that are struggling to find their place in the contemporary city. Often, because of the lack of un­derstanding of their potential use, they stay neglected, commemorating a certain aspect of human heritage.<br>Landfill is another of this type of landform, created by humans for the simple reason to discard unwanted material - one that stands today as a monument to the society’s inability to plan for the long-term. The complex nature of the landfill requires a complex multi-disci­plinary range of answers: our team brings together arts, architecture and communi­ty-based planning.</span>

Its mission is to present, preserve, interpret, proselytize and advocate on behalf of avant-garde art, especially forms that may be vulnerable due to institutional neglect, cultural bias, their ephemeral nature, or politically unpopular content. Franklin Furnace is dedicated to serving artists by providing both physical and virtual venues for the presentation of time-based art, including but not limited to artists' books and periodicals, installation art, performance art, and unforeseen contemporary avant-garde artforms; and to undertake other activities related to these purposes.

This project is an outgrowth of the exhibition. <br><br>
